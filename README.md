# MelvorMods_Armament_Expanded
Adds a Souls inspired weapon upgrade system, new types of weapons (whips, spears, and bombs) to the game, and now every weapon has at least one special attack.

# Description
## New Weapon Types
I've added three new weapon types to the game two to fill in what I saw as gaps in the weapon offerings, and one just for fun.
### Whips
Roughly on par with shortbows in terms of power, but allows you to use shields/offhand and doesn't require ammo.
### Spears
Slightly faster and weaker then the 2H swords, but boost Stab instead of Slash
### Throwable Bombs
They're bombs. Throwable. What more do you want? (make charges in Herblore and then turn them into live charges via Smithing).
## Weapon Scaling
Most early game weapons can be upgraded with a new material called Weaponite. It comes in a few flavors, mainly Shards, Large Shards, Chunks, and Slabs. With them you will be able to upgrade most unnamed weapons up to +10. Each level will boost the weapons stats by 10% of its base value. You can acquire Weaponite from enemies and the shop.
