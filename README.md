# MelvorMods_Armament_Expanded
Adds a Souls inspired weapon upgrade system, new types of weapons (whips, spears, and bombs) to the game, and now every weapon has at least one special attack.

# Descrption
## New Weapon Types
I've added three new weapon types to the game two to fill in what I saw as gabs, and one just for fun.
### Whips
### Spears
### Throwable Bombs
## Weapon Scaling
Most early game weapons can be upgraded with a new material called Weaponite. It comes in a few flavors, mainly Shards, Large Shards, Chunks, and Slabs. With them you will be able to upgrade most unnammed weapons up to +10. Each level will boost the weapons stats by 10% of its base value. You can aquire weaponite from enemies and the shop.
